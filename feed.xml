<p><a href="https://www.iapro.com/">IAPro</a> is a software package for managing internal affairs cases that is used by many police departments in Massachusetts, including the Boston Police Department, and the State Police. See the <a href="https://www.iapro.com/clients">IAPro list of clients</a>; they have hundreds around the world.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in collecting, through public records requests, internal affairs and discipline data from Massachusetts police departments. In that pursuit, understanding the software that stores these records is crucial.</p>

<p>To that end, working from the <a href="https://www.iapro.com/clients">list of IAPro clients</a>, I made public records requests to four municipalities, asking for “documentation, user guides, administration manuals, and similar documents” related to the <a href="https://www.iapro.com/pages/iapro">IAPro</a> and <a href="https://www.iapro.com/pages/blueteam">BlueTeam</a> software products.</p>

<p>Previously, Woke Windows just had the <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/data_sources/2019_tickets">traffic tickets written in 2019</a>. Now we have data spanning the years 2011 through 2020.</p>

<p>These records have fields indicating: the Boston Police officer who wrote the ticket, the location where the ticket was written, the race and sex of the driver, and much more.</p>

<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a discrepancy between the <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/data_sources/2019_tickets">2019 dataset</a> and the new <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/data_sources/2011_2020_citations">2011 - 2020 dataset</a>.</p>

<p>There are 119 citations that appear in the 2019 dataset but do not appear in the new data.</p>

<p>I haven’t identified a pattern to explain why these citations disappeared. If you have a theory, or if you have more MassDOT traffic ticket data I could compare against, please reach out!</p>

<h2 id="get-the-data">Get the data</h2>
<p>There are a few ways you can access this data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you want to quickly browse all the tickets without downloading anything? Try the <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/citations">big table of traffic citations</a> on Woke Windows.</li>
  <li>Do you want to browse tickets written by a particular officer? <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/officers">Look up an individual officer</a> on Woke Windows and view all the data we have on that officer, including traffic tickets written.</li>
  <li>Do you want to download a spreadsheet which you can filter in Excel (e.g. take all the tickets written by one-or-more officers and then do an analysis based on location, race, etc.)? <a href="https://github.com/nstory/boston_pd_citations">Download data formatted for Excel</a>; these spreadsheets have been joined with Boston PD roster data, making it easy to identify the officer who wrote each ticket.</li>
  <li>Do you need the raw data provided by MassDOT? See <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/data_sources/2011_2020_citations">2011 - 2020 Traffic Tickets</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this database, you can search appeals made to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, including the text of determinations issued by the Commonwealth’s Supervisor of Records (while the Commonwealth does provide <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/AppealsWeb/AppealsStatus.aspx">a page for searching appeals</a>, it does not allow for full text searches).</p>

<p>A requestor of public records will typically file an appeal when an agency or municipality does not respond to a request, denies access to a record, or is otherwise unreasonable. The Supervisor will then weigh in, and, if the agency is not complying with the law, issue an order for the agency to do so. See <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/prepdf/guide.pdf">A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law</a> for the full story.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-this-useful">How is this useful?</h2>

<p>The appeals are full of useful information that can inform your own public records requests.</p>

<p><em>Are you curious what stories the Boston Globe is working on?</em> Search the database for <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/appeals?q=%22boston+globe%22">appeals containing “boston globe”</a>.</p>

<p><em>Are you interested in the files available from some agency, but don’t know what to ask for?</em> Search the database for appeals relating to that agency (e.g. <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/appeals?q=custodian+%7E%22board+of+registration+in+medicine%22">The Board of Registration in Medicine</a>) and read the decisions; see what other requestors ask for.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-this-to-get-records">Can I use this to get records?</h2>
<p>Yes!</p>

<p>As an example, I’ll show you how I was able to use this database to get the Internal Affairs log for the <a href="https://everettpolicema.com/">Everett Police Department</a>.</p>

<p>First run a search for <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/appeals?q=%22everett+police%22+%22internal+affairs%22">everett police internal affairs</a>:
<img src="/assets/images/appeals_database/search_results.png" alt="&quot;everett police&quot; &quot;internal affairs&quot; search results" /></p>

<p>Of the cases returned, <a href="https://www.wokewindows.org/appeals/20201532">Appeal #20201532</a> is particularly interesting. According to the determiniation <a href="https://wokewindows-data.s3.amazonaws.com/appeals/16957/spr201532.pdf">spr201532.pdf</a>, it regards a request for “all alleged misconduct complaints filed with the Everett Police Department during calendar years 2010 through 2019.”
<img src="/assets/images/appeals_database/first_para.png" alt="copies of records that describe all alleged misconduct complaints filed with the Everett Police Department during calendar years 2010 through 2019" /></p>

<p>The last paragraph of the determination orders “A copy of any such response must be provided to this office.”
<img src="/assets/images/appeals_database/last_para.png" alt="A copy of any such response must be provided to this office" /></p>

<p>This means it’s likely the Supervisor of Records now has a copy of these files. So, I sent a public records request to the <a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/prepra/prasecrao.htm">Secretary of the Commonwealth’s Records Access Officer</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/appeals_database/nstory_prr.png" alt="Public Records Request: Records provided for SPR20/1356 and SPR20/1532" /></p>

<p>Six days later I received a response:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/appeals_database/prr_response.png" alt="Please find attached responsive records" />
<a href="https://wokewindows-data.s3.amazonaws.com/everett_responses.zip">Download the Everett SPR20/1356 and SPR20/1532 files</a></p>

<p>Why is this exciting? For the original requester to get these files, he went through a two month process including two appeals. We were able to get the same files in a fraction of the time.</p>

<p>It won’t always be the case that the Supervisor of Records will have an electronic copy of an agency’s response. In those cases, you can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reach out to the original requestor (while public records requests and appeals can be made anonymously, most people choose to include their name and organization; you can Google them)</li>
  <li>or make a request to the original agency and ask for any records they sent to the requestor</li>
</ul>

  <li>R000230-061620, R000864-102320, R000905-102920 — settlements paid by the City of Boston for police misconduct</li>
  <li>R000904-102920 — thousands of claims related to car crashes</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, all the responses are PDF documents, so, analysis/parsing is going to be a pain.</p>

<td>(The following is from two (2) separate email requests) I wanted to make a records request for payroll data for the Boston Police Department. I‚Äôll also send a separate email for a similar request for other city departments. I am seeking an electronic copy of the following payroll data for the BDP:Name, Job Title, Department, Postal Code, Annual Pay Rate, Gender, Race or Ethnic Group, Union Status (Union or nonunion), bargaining group (BPPA, Superior Officers, etc), sworn officer or civilian, Start Date, Service Date, Annual Rate, and whether the employee is Full or Part Time.One point of clarification: Service Date versus Start Date. I believe that service date is the first time someone was hired by the city and start date is the most recent time someone was hired by the city. If that is incorrect, let me know. -- Here is the second request I mentioned. I wanted to make a records request for payroll data for all other city departments, including fire and schools. (I requested the same data for the police department in my previous ema l). I am seeking an electronic copy of the following payroll data:Name, Job Title, Department, Postal Code, Annual Pay Rate, Gender, Race or Ethnic Group, Union Status (Union or nonunion), bargaining group, Start Date, Service Date, Annual Rate, and whether the employee is Full or Part Time.</td>

<td>I am seeking data/records from the payroll department regarding the hours BPD Detective Robert M. Tu ly worked in 2014. This is a request for the human resource/payroll department, not the police department. Here is what I'm seeking: I would like the total number of hours that Robert M. Tu ly worked in 2014 before his retirement in July 2014. In addition, I would l ke a breakdown of Tully's 2014 hours.

Payroll records show Tu ly earned $40,520.79 in regular pay, $22,202.42 in OT, and $37,519.66 in 'other' pay.

<td>I am seeking information and data related to crashes or accidents involving city-owned vehicles. This request w ll be primarily for the Law Department, although I am seeking information about all city vehicles, including departments that operate out of City Hall, police, fire, and schools. Specifically I am seeking electronic records or data documenting all insurance payouts and civil lawsuits settlements since Jan 1, 2010. By ‚Äúinsurance payouts‚Äù I am referring to the City‚Äôs self-insurance for vehicles and any payments the City had to make to other individuals or insurance companies. The records or data I‚Äôm seeking should include: 1) CRA-65 crash reports or other reports or data that include the following information -Name of the city employee driving, title, department - Names of other involved drivers or individuals -Date and time of accident -Description of accident -location of accident -Description of any citations that includes offense and citation number 2) Details of any insurance payout or financial settlement that include: -amount of payment -date of payment -name of payee -name of city employee, title, department -corresponding civil court docket number or other case number or reference numbers 3) Details of any other civil lawsuit or claim stemming from a motor vehicle accident in which the city Law Department defended a city employee even if there was no insurance payout or financial settlement. This data should include: --name of city employee, title, department --name of other driver involved --corresponding civil court docket number or other case number or reference numbers I‚Äôm happy to discuss this request if it is overly broad or otherwise cumbersome. I‚Äôm hoping that much of this information may be available in a Law Department case tracking file and/or a ledger of insurance payouts and settlements. If the CRA-65 crash reports prove difficult, let‚Äôs discuss another way to get that that same information. My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Thank you, Andrew</td>
