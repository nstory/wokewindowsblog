The City of Boston responded to my public records request (PRR) for an export of the public records requests in the [Boston Public Records Center](https://bostonma.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs) (yeah, it's a little meta). These records were provided to me on Dec 8, 2020.

The log was provided to me as two files. One contains requests to the Boston Police Department (BPD), and one contains requests to all other departments. The police file does not contain a description of the records requested.

These logs are useful for at least two reasons:

1. You can use this list to get ideas for PRRs to make. This is a great way to learn from the requests made by experienced journalists, lawyers, and activists.
2. You can request copies of the public records already gathered for another party. This is potentially an easy way to get a lot of documents quickly.

I have two outstanding requests to the City of Boston for previously requested records based on these logs: [boston-public-records-responses-non-police-9407](https://www.foiamachine.org/foi/boston-public-records-responses-non-police-9407/?sharing=TFRNUJV10BD4) and [boston-public-records-responses-police-9408](https://www.foiamachine.org/foi/boston-public-records-responses-police-9408/?sharing=6Z2RNBW9SGDY)

Do you have any questions, ideas, or have you done anything interesting with this data? Reach out to me on Twitter [@nathan_story](https://twitter.com/nathan_story).
