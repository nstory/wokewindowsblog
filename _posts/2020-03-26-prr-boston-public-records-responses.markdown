Following up on my [request for the Boston Public Records Log](/2021/01/14/boston-public-records-log.html), I requested the responses to a number of public records requests.

I've posted those responses below.

The most interesting are problably:
* B000971-070120 &mdash; Boston Police Internal Affairs case log from 2010 to sometime in 2020 (though I don't believe this has cases beyond the [internal affairs data already on Woke Windows](https://www.wokewindows.org/help/internal_affairs))
* R000230-061620, R000864-102320, R000905-102920 &mdash; settlements paid by the City of Boston for police misconduct
* R000904-102920 &mdash; thousands of claims related to car crashes

Unfortunately, all the responses are PDF documents, so, analysis/parsing is going to be a pain.

<td>(The following is from two (2) separate email requests) I wanted to make a records request for payroll data for the Boston Police Department. I‚Äôll also send a separate email for a similar request for other city departments. I am seeking an electronic copy of the following payroll data for the BDP:Name, Job Title, Department, Postal Code, Annual Pay Rate, Gender, Race or Ethnic Group, Union Status (Union or nonunion), bargaining group (BPPA, Superior Officers, etc), sworn officer or civilian, Start Date, Service Date, Annual Rate, and whether the employee is Full or Part Time.One point of clarification: Service Date versus Start Date. I believe that service date is the first time someone was hired by the city and start date is the most recent time someone was hired by the city. If that is incorrect, let me know. -- Here is the second request I mentioned. I wanted to make a records request for payroll data for all other city departments, including fire and schools. (I requested the same data for the police department in my previous ema l). I am seeking an electronic copy of the following payroll data:Name, Job Title, Department, Postal Code, Annual Pay Rate, Gender, Race or Ethnic Group, Union Status (Union or nonunion), bargaining group, Start Date, Service Date, Annual Rate, and whether the employee is Full or Part Time.</td>

<td>I am seeking data/records from the payroll department regarding the hours BPD Detective Robert M. Tu ly worked in 2014. This is a request for the human resource/payroll department, not the police department. Here is what I'm seeking: I would like the total number of hours that Robert M. Tu ly worked in 2014 before his retirement in July 2014. In addition, I would l ke a breakdown of Tully's 2014 hours. I want to know how many hours he was 1) at work being paid regular time, 2) at work being paid OT, and 3) paid while he was on leave. Payroll records show Tu ly earned $40,520.79 in regular pay, $22,202.42 in OT, and $37,519.66 in 'other' pay. I want to confirm that the regular pay and OT was for time he was at work in 2014 and that other pay was for sick or vacation buyback.</td>

<td>I am seeking information and data related to crashes or accidents involving city-owned vehicles. This request w ll be primarily for the Law Department, although I am seeking information about all city vehicles, including departments that operate out of City Hall, police, fire, and schools. Specifically I am seeking electronic records or data documenting all insurance payouts and civil lawsuits settlements since Jan 1, 2010. By ‚Äúinsurance payouts‚Äù I am referring to the City‚Äôs self-insurance for vehicles and any payments the City had to make to other individuals or insurance companies. The records or data I‚Äôm seeking should include: 1) CRA-65 crash reports or other reports or data that include the following information -Name of the city employee driving, title, department - Names of other involved drivers or individuals -Date and time of accident -Description of accident -location of accident -Description of any citations that includes offense and citation number 2) Details of any insurance payout or financial settlement that include: -amount of payment -date of payment -name of payee -name of city employee, title, department -corresponding civil court docket number or other case number or reference numbers 3) Details of any other civil lawsuit or claim stemming from a motor vehicle accident in which the city Law Department defended a city employee even if there was no insurance payout or financial settlement. This data should include: --name of city employee, title, department --name of other driver involved --corresponding civil court docket number or other case number or reference numbers I‚Äôm happy to discuss this request if it is overly broad or otherwise cumbersome. I‚Äôm hoping that much of this information may be available in a Law Department case tracking file and/or a ledger of insurance payouts and settlements. If the CRA-65 crash reports prove difficult, let‚Äôs discuss another way to get that that same information. My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Thank you, Andrew</td>
