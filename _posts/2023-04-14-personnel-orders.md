I forgot to publish these when I received them (close to two years ago now!)

These are personnel orders from the Boston Police Department (BPD). There are
4,284 pages here; they document promotions, commendations, retirements, firings,
instances of officers being disciplined, and more.

These records were originally requested by the [Boston
Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/) and used in a series of articles

I made a public records request to the City of Boston for the files sent to the
Globe.
