[IAPro](https://www.iapro.com/) is a software package for managing internal affairs cases that is used by many police departments in Massachusetts, including the Boston Police Department, and the State Police. See the [IAPro list of clients](https://www.iapro.com/clients); they have hundreds around the world.

I am particularly interested in collecting, through public records requests, internal affairs and discipline data from Massachusetts police departments. In that pursuit, understanding the software that stores these records is crucial.

To that end, working from the [list of IAPro clients](https://www.iapro.com/clients), I made public records requests to four municipalities, asking for "documentation, user guides, administration manuals, and similar documents" related to the [IAPro](https://www.iapro.com/pages/iapro) and [BlueTeam](https://www.iapro.com/pages/blueteam) software products.

## Requests and Responses
I posted below the requests I made and the responses I received. The most interesting are [IAProManual.pdf](https://wokewindows-data.s3.amazonaws.com/iapro/somerville/IAProManual.pdf) and [IAPro_Administrator's_Manual.pdf](https://wokewindows-data.s3.amazonaws.com/iapro/somerville/IAPro_Administrator's_Manual.pdf), both provided by Somerville.
